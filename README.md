## The Python Adventures

[via Mark:](https://github.com/Marrrrrrk/ThePythonAdventures)

The Python Adventures is a project designed to foster the learning of, you guessed it, Python.

On a sunny Saturday afternoon I made a proposition to my friend Ian. I told him to pick a language he wanted to learn and together we would explore. Every two weeks a new 'challenge' would be issued from a third party, our friend Mike. 

The setup is simple - whoever writes the best program that accomplishes the tasks set forth in the challenge earns a point (Mike is the judge). Each round is best of five. The winner of the round proudly displays a trophy until unseated in succeding rounds.

This repo serves as a center to dump the code for each challenge once a winner is declared.

As I type this on Dec. 3, 2013 I am also very new to git/github. This also serves a dual purpose for me to get better with both. Feel free to contact me and tell me to hit my head against the wall because of how stupid I was with A. B. or C.

You get the idea.
